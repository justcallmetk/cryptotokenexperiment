# cryptotokenexperiment
## This is my first attempt creating a unique Crypto based token.

It is said that by the year 2053, the median "African-American" household-income will be $0.
 - This is the equivalent to a natural disater in many ways. The people that will most be afected by technological advances are people who live below the poverty line, 
   regardless of sex, gender, religion or national origin.

 - To help curb that reality, I am creating this repository to inspire and spark the minds of creatives who can help bridge the gaps in learning within the 
   innercity schools and other areas deeply affected by the lack of resources, lack of order or outright neglect.

Using Solona's Blockchain and Crytopcurrency Sol, I am creating a token based rewards system for my students in grades K-8. 

 - This experiment's aim is to replace our old stsyem of giving physical/tangible rewards such as "marbles", "tickets" or "school bucks" and 
instead prepare our students for the ever changing world of digital currencies and rewards structures.

 - By introducing thses concepts early in our student's development, we will prepare them for the new world of trading, buying and owning digital content 
as well as introduce them to important STEM concepts.
